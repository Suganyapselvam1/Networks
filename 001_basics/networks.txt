What is networks?
A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols for moving information from one device to another.

Open System Interconnect Model:(OSI Model)
1. Physical layer - bits - twisted cable, fiber optical cable
    it is underlying cable that transmits the data as bit.(1,0s)
2. Data link layer - Frames - ethernet
    Data link layer is responsbile for encoding the frames into bits and trasmit. After the trasmission, the data link layer will decode the bits into frames again.
3. Network layer - packet - ip(internet protocol)
    It is responsbile of trasmitting the packet to the destination from source.
4. Transport layer - segment - TCP(Transmission control protocol)/UDP User datagram protocol
5. Session layer - 
6. Presentation layer - ASCII
7. Application layer - HTTP
